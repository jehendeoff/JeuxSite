# How to use these example ?

Well since I own the domain jehende.fr you can 
 - use your own dns server to point to your site (would only work if everyon has the same dns)
 - modify you host file

## The easiest way is to edit the host file at `C:/WINDOWS/system32/drivers/etc/hosts` using an editor like notepad++ and adding 2 lines :
`
127.0.0.1 jehende.fr
127.0.0.1 jeuxgate.jehende.fr
`

# Don't forget to delete those two lines once you're finished testing with examples!
